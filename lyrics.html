            <span>MY HEART WILL GO ON</span>

            Every night in my dreams
            I see you. I feel you.
            That is how I know you go on.
            
            Far across the distance
            And spaces between us
            You have come to show you go on.
            
            Near, far, wherever you are
            I believe that the heart does go on
            Once more you open the door
            And you're here in my heart
            And my heart will go on and on
            
            Love can touch us one time
            And last for a lifetime
            And never go till we're one
            
            Love was when I loved you
            One true time I hold to
            In my life we'll always go on
            
            Near, far, wherever you are
            I believe that the heart does go on
            Once more you open the door
            And you're here in my heart
            And my heart will go on and on
            
            There is some love that will not
            go away
            
            You're here, there's nothing I fear,
            And I know that my heart will go on
            We'll stay forever this way
            You are safe in my heart
            And my heart will go on and on
